# Uploading

There are more ways to upload than we can keep up withâ€¦

[[toc]]

## Website

From the site you can drag and drop any file(s) up upload them.

If you navigate to an album, any files you drop will upload to that album.

## Token

To upload files from elsewhere you will need your Auth Token and Site URL.

From the user menu you can Copy Token or URL.

This is needed to use an upload [Client](#clients).

## Clients

You can download one-click configurations for many clients on the User page.

Navigate to: `User Settings` > `Clients`

There is also a list of [supported clients](../clients/home.md).

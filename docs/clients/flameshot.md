# Flameshot

For Linux, you should use the [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) client.

## Setup

Navigate to: `User Settings` > `Clients`

Click on the Flameshot Script icon to download the `.sh` file.

This script contains your token, save it somewhere securely on the system.

The script launches flameshot and uploads the resulting file to the server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script uses `curl` to upload the file which must be installed.
